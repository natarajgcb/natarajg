          As of 5 Apr 2022, Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden is no longer located at the corner of 20th & Pico due to the violent, illegal actions of the owners and managers of the adjacent Eddie&#39;s Liquor.
          <br/><br/>Please <a href="" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">see this YouTube video</a> of Singh, owner of Eddie&#39;s Liquor, physically assaulting Master Nataraj G on public property, without any provocation other than speaking to reach a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
          <br/><br/>Please also see the description associated with this video to learn more about what happened, how the community is responding and how you can get involved in building a safer, healthier neighborhood, city and world together.
          <br/><br/>Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden has found a more peaceful and loving new home in the neighborhood and is building new programs to continue serving the community.

        Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden was a Community Garden and Urban Farm located at the corner of 20th Street and Pico Avenue in the lovely Pico Neighborhood of Santa Monica, California on occupied Tongva land (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w91urxADWXNq1zhe8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">map</a>) from July 2021 to April 2022. We grew healthy, better-than-organic, natural living foods using sustainable, regenerative gardening practices charged with biofield and energetic healing practices that result in fresh, tasty, nourishing food that improves the health of the soil, the health of our neighborhood and our entire Mother Earth.

      <MNGH2>Building a New World of Peace, Love, Joy, Balance and Gratitude Together</MNGH2>

      <MNGBody>
        We shared all food freely with neighbors and visitors to the garden, many of whom are food insecure, housing insecure and in need of holistic healthcare that addresses mental, emotional, spiritual and physical wellbeing. As our garden was located next to a liquor store, across the street from a Burger King and between two half-way homes, many neighbors expressed gratitude for a healthy alternative to food and drink that are harmful, addictive and often the only food options for local residents of lower socio-economic standing, experiencing the ongoing systemic violence of racism, colonization, capitalism and consumerism harming our People and our Planet.
        <br/><br/>
        The Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden community continues to serve as a space for anyone and everyone to rebuild their relationship with Mother Earth, get involved in taking care of Her and experiencing how She abundantly takes care of us. We believe that no one can own the land just as no one can own the air, water or sunshine. We are here to take care of these free and abundant life-giving gifts so that we may all thrive and prosper in balance with the universe and one another. We invite all beings to honor their sense of belonging with the Earth, with plants, animals and people, and with the Spiritual Energies that connect us all at Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden. This is an affordable, practical, easily accessible way for all people to revolutionize our individual, collective and planetary health and wellbeing while enjoying fresh, tasty food and spreading Peace and Love.
        <br/><br/>
        The Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden is a partnership of many dedicated community members and organizations residing in Santa Monica and Venice. Please <a href="mailto:one@natarajg.space?subject=PicoRoots" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">email Master Nataraj G</a> or <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#picoroots:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">join our secure chat room</a> to connect, organize and grow the garden with us.
        <br/><br/>
        The Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden is also aligned and in solidarity with numerous international organizations and movements to radically change our ways of life such that we are all individually and collectively far healthier while ensuring Mother Earth, our home, is well taken care of. Some of these organizations and movements include: #savesoil with Sadhguru, The United Nations and the Isha Foundation; Fridays for Future with youth activist leader Greta Thunberg; Breaking Boundaries with climate scientist Johan Rockstr√∂m; Green New Deal with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Naomi Klein and Jeremy Rifkin; Movements for Indigenous Sovereignty and Black Liberation with the Climate Justice Alliance and our local Indigenous Native and Black Elders.
        <br/><br/>
        We honor the Tongva, Chumash and neighboring Indigenous lands we are on (the Los Angeles basin region) and share our Energy to take care of and grow the Pico Roots Revolutionary Garden so we may all live in Abundance, aligned with our Highest and Truest Infinite Self, for a New World rooted in the Divine Energies of Peace, Love, Joy, Balance and Gratitude.
